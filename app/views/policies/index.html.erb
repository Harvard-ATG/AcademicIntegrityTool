      As stated in <a href="http://infoforfaculty.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k95368&pageid=icb.page586095" title="Information for Faculty">Information for Faculty</a>: “It is essential that instructors set out carefully in writing and at the outset of a course or course assignment the extent of permissible student collaboration in the preparation of papers, computer programs, or examinations. <strong>Students must assume that collaboration in the completion of assignments is permitted unless explicitly prohibited by the instructor.</strong> Students should be reminded that they are expected to acknowledge any collaboration and its extent in all submitted work.”

    If you choose to write your own policy on collaboration, keep the following guidelines in mind.
  </p>

  <ol>
      <li>
        You should outline explicitly what students may or may not discuss with their classmates outside the classroom and how best to capture those discussions on formal work submitted for course credit.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may want to include citation resources for students including the <a href="http://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu/" title="Harvard Guide to Using Sources">Harvard Guide to Using Sources</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may want to include information about conforming to the College’s policies on academic integrity found in the <a href="http://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/" title="Harvard College Handbook for Students">Harvard College Handbook for Students</a>.

## Academic Integrity Policy Tool ##

The Academic Integrity Policy Tool is an LTI-compliant application written with the Ruby on Rails open-source web framework. Although LTI-compliant, the application relies on interacting with the Canvas Learning Management System and proprietary data from Harvard University. Therefore, some serious tweaking is required to have the tool running in an environment outside of the Harvard University LMS. Future updates will remediate these issues by abstracting the appropriate functionality.


At the moment, this documentation is sparse (indeed, "sparse" is being generous, since the documentation you are reading is about all that exists). This, too, will be remdiated. Promise.
